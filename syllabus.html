<p><strong>Quiz instructions</strong> <a name="exams" id="forum"></a></p>
<p>This course has 6-8 quizzes. Students should plan a time to take the timed Moodle quizzes in a quiet location<em></em> on the day that the quiz is available. The quizzes will generally take 10-20 minutes to complete. Though notes, books, and IDEs will be available, students should be prepared to rapidly respond to the questions.  The quiz will be timed with the assumption that the materials have been studied before the start of the quiz. This is a new feature in the course, so some  scheduling, timing, or scope adjustments may be required. The instructor will strive to provide ample warning for any such changes. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Message Board: <br />
</strong>We are using Piazza for class discussion. Classmates, teaching assistants (TAs), and  instructors can view your public posts. Participation in discussions of  lectures, in-class exercises, lecture notes, and related current events are encouraged. Public posts can also be used for clarification of homework question instructions. </p>
<p>Use the following guidelines for help with homework-related questions:</p>
     <ul>
       <li> Post homework-related questions as private messages on the board to the all instructional staff. Rather than sending email, we prefer that you post your questions   on Piazza. Teaching staff will not respond to questions sent via email.</li>
       <li>Private questions  that could benefit the entire class may be made public by teaching staff, unless you specify otherwise.</li>
       <li>For code-related questions, formulate a concise explanation describing the part of the code appears to be causing problems. The speed and helpfulness of responses is strongly tied to the specificity and clarity of the question. Posting an entire script with a note like &quot;I can't figure out why this isn't working&quot;, will not yield helpful results.</li>
       <li>If a script is throwing an error, copy and paste the complete error in the question.</li>
       <li>Use the 'code' button to preserve code format.<a name="late" id="forum3"></a></li>
     </ul>
     <p> If you have any problems with Piazza or feedback for the Piazza developers,   email team@piazza.com.</p>

    <p> <strong>Late policy for homework:</strong> The assignments are due   at 10pm EST on the due date. Moodle submission closes at 10:15pm; The   15 minute grace period is given on Moodle, to allow for last minute   blunders, but the assignment is due at 10pm. Assignments submitted at 10:16pm are 16 minutes late. For assignments turned in   after the due date, a late penalty is applied to the grade based on the   following equation:<br />
      <br />
      penalty = 
    10*2<sup>(r-1)</sup>% where <em>r</em> is the number of 24-hour periods late. </p>
     <p>The first 24 hour period begins at 10:15pm on the day it is due. If, for example, an assignment is submitted  at  10:16pm on the day it was due, 10% will be removed from the grade for that assignment (10*2<sup>(1-1)</sup> =10*2<sup>0</sup> = 10*1 = 10%) .<br />
       <br />
       <em>If you have some issue submitting late homework, </em> <strong>notify the instructors via a private note on Piazza</strong>. Mark the post with the homework number folder and the 'late' folder. ***No email submissions are accepted.***<br />
       <br />
     The only exceptions to the late submission policy are afforded to those  with   personal emergencies (e.g., illness, death, or medical emergency in the    immediate family) with  documentation.<br />
    <strong><hr />
     Homework guidelines:</strong></p>
     <a name="homework" id="academicConduct2"></a>
    <ol>
      <li>All submission deadlines are given in terms of Eastern Standard Time (EST).</li>
       <li>Name script file submissions exactly as specified in <strong>bold</strong> at the beginning of the exercise in the book. Points will be deducted for incorrectly named scripts. E.g.,  if the name in bold is <strong>foobar.py</strong>, and you submit a script named 'foobarr.py' instead of 'foobar.py', points will be deducted.</li>
       <li>The header comments of each script submitted must include the student name and unity ID. The<em> unity ID</em> is the alpha-numeric code  (e.g., <code>jkrowlin</code>). The <em>student ID number</em> (e.g. 300335468) is not used in this class.  The naming instructions are designed to streamline the grading process, so this is important for running the class --This means that points will be deducted for not following instructions. </li>
       <li> See the &quot;<strong>Academic Intregrity</strong>&quot; section of the syllabus regarding acceptable forms of help on homework.</li>
       <li>Points for homework assignments vary depending on content. Generally, scripts are worth 10 points each and short answer questions are worth 1 or 2 points per part.  </li>
       <li>Don't zip submissions. Moodle creates a directory for each homework submission. Inside this directory, it automatically creates one folder for each student. All the files  submitted by <code>jkrowlin</code> for an assignment are automatically  placed  in a <code>jkrowlin</code> directory. So, files are already grouped by unity ID. </li>
       <li>If you complete an assignment and want to submit it before the Moodle submission for this assignment has opened, post a private message for the instructors on Piazza. This request will be handled as promptly as possible<strong>.</strong>  <em>(No email submissions are accepted.) Submissions are generally not permitted prior to one week before the due date.</em></li>
       <li>In case of tardiness, see the <strong>&quot;Late policy for homework&quot;</strong> section of the syllabus.</li>

     <hr /><p><strong>Grade Changes</strong><a name="integrity" id="integrity"></a><br />
Students should review  grades and comments when they are posted. If a mistake is discovered in any grade received (for example,         a        correct answer  was marked wrong or a score was summed        incorrectly), the student should post a private Piazza message  to the instructors. The note should indicate which assignment grade is under dispute and explain which part of the work seems to be graded        incorrectly. The message must be submitted <em>within one week </em>of the date on which it was returned. After one week,  grades are final. </p>
    <hr /><p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></p>
    <p>Professional student conduct is required throughout the course. Read the <a href="https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/">NCSU policy overview</a> and Sections 8 and 9 of the <a href="https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/code/"> Code of Student Conduct</a> and the following instructions:</p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li><strong>Academic honesty and homework assignments</strong><br />
We know the material can be challenging, so you should take advantage of the teaching staff help. Use office hours and the message board to interact with the teaching assistants and instructor when you are struggling with the homework.<strong><br />
</strong>Beyond this, however, students are required to do homework          assignments individually.  Study groups may discuss code from in-class exercises, code from the course reading, and code from the course slides, but they may not do the homework together. Plagiarism detection software will be used on programming assignments to identify students who        have        copied        code        from one another. Copying will not be tolerated. The work you submit must be your own. <br />
<br />
        Examples of cheating          are:        looking        at        another        student's        code,        writing        your        program        while        talking        to        someone        else about it, talking  another student through the solution        code, allowing others to look at your solution code, obtaining        code from a student who is taking GIS 540 or took GIS 540 during a previous semester, and obtaining code from family, friends, colleagues, or others. Code snippets from the examples provided for class and the ArcGIS Resources help pages may be used; However, copying code from other Internet sources is also considered cheating. Sharing code on the message board or in other ways is a violation of the NCSU Code of Student Conduct. If        you        have any doubts about what is allowed when completing homework assignments, ask the instructor.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li><strong> Academic honesty and exams <br />
          </strong>Exams must be completed individually. Students must not discuss the exam concepts, questions, or answers until the exams have been returned. Students must take the exams in an approved testing center or with an approved proctor. You should prepare your own exam notes and the work you submit on the exam must be your own. <br />
          <br />
      </li>
      <li><strong>Academic honesty and projects</strong> <a name="integrityProj" id="integrity2"></a><br />
       All students must complete the project alone. Students must not post their code in public notes on the message board or obtain, copy, or look at another student's or former student's pseudocode or source code unless otherwise specified by the instructor. Questions that are deemed useful for the entire class may be converted to public posts.<br />
      <br />
      Projects are designed to use concepts and skills learned in the class for the bulk of the work in the project. However,  a class project may occasionally require a student to solve a problem that goes beyond the scope of the materials taught in the course. In this situation, students may conduct research online to solve these out-of-scope questions. If a code snippet is used for a project, the student must do two things:
        <ol> 
          <li>Insert comments within the code to site the source of the code, and clearly indicate which lines of code are from this online source.</li>
          <li>Research the unfamiliar components of this code and modify the code so that each step can be clearly explained in terms of concepts learned in class. Then, insert comments within the code to explain the purpose of each line of code. </li>
        </ol>
      See the 'Citing a project found code snippet' box below for an example.  Citing an outside online source for code that <em>is</em> part of the course material is considered cheating. Code from outside sources should <em>only be used when necessary</em> and <em>should not constitute a large portion of the project</em> code. Also, students should not use code that they can't explain. If        you        have any doubts about what is allowed, ask the instructor. <br />
      <br />
      <table  border="3">
        <tr>
          <td><p><strong>Citing a project  code snippet</strong></p>
            <p>Problem: Given a date, I need to find the next day's date in my project code. We didn't go over this in class, so I search online. I search online and find the following example on the Stack Overflow website:</p>
            <div class="highlight">
              <pre><span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2003</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>

            </div>
            <p>This code does two steps at once in the third line of code. I separate these lines of code. Next, I read the <code>datatime</code> module documentation to understand the <code>timedelta</code> function. My code only deals with the date (2003, 8, 20), not the date and time (2003,8,20,12,4,5), so I use only the date in my code. I add a comment to acknowledge that the code is not my own. Last, I add a code comment to explain each line of code I use from this source:</p>

    <hr /><p><strong>Accommodation of students with disabilities: </strong>Reasonable accommodations will be made for  students with verifiable disabilities.   In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must  register with Disability Services for Students at 1900 Student Health   Center, Campus Box 7509,  515-7653.  For more information on NC  State's policy on working with students with disabilities, please see <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/provost/offices/affirm_action/dss/"> the university provisions and policies for disabled students</a></p>
<hr />     <p><strong>Attendance policy:</strong> This is a very intensive course as you will be  learning highly technical skills and learning new ways to conceptualize and  analyze GIS problems.  Therefore, I am  taking very seriously your instructions to be at every class. If you must miss a class it is your responsibility to make up the material. See also  <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">university attendance regulations and university definitions of excused absences.  </a></p>
 <hr /><p><strong>Class evaluations online:</strong>
       <a href="https://classeval.ncsu.edu">Online class evaluations</a> will be available for students to complete  during the last week of class. Students will receive an email message directing them  to a website where they can login using their Unity ID and complete  evaluations.  All evaluations are  confidential; instructors will never know how any one student responded to any  question, and students will never know the ratings for any particular  instructors. For additional information write to the student help desk:   classeval@ncsu.edu</p>
     <hr />
     <p><strong> Audit: </strong> Audit  students  must complete all homework assignments and quizzes/exams with a 70% total average score.  That is, they do not have to complete the project. <br />
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Mailing list and website: </strong>Student NCSU email address will be added or deleted from the course mailing list  automatically based on registration status in the course. Instructors can not add an non-NCSU address to the mailing list. Students are responsible for announcements sent to the NCSU email address. <a href="http://help.ncsu.edu/solutions/all/22.php">Set up mail forwarding</a>, if necessary. </p>
     <p>Updates to the online schedule will be made during the semester. Students can subscribe to updates of the course site.</p>
    <hr /><p><strong>“Withdrawal”                   and “Incomplete” Polices: </strong>Any student who enrolls,                   but does not complete the course work or process a withdrawal form before                   the end of the University’s official drop period for the semester will                   receive a 0, unless they initiate one of the following options: </p>
     <blockquote>
       <p>a. The student                       is passing and officially drops the course after six weeks. In this                       case the student will be given a “W”. Passing this course is defined                       as having earned an average grade in the course of a C or above                       on the date of the student’s request for the “W”. This option will                       only be available in keeping with the current NCSU policy. </p>
       <p>b. The student                       receives an “I”. This grade will be given only in special documented                       circumstances when a student, for some serious reason, cannot complete                       the course by the required deadline. An “I” will be given only if                       the student has completed at least 80% of the course. An “I” cannot                       be used to simply avoid a 0 grade. All work to complete the course                       must be finished by the end of the next semester or the “I” will be                       changed to a 0 grade. This option will only be available in keeping                       with the current NCSU policy. </p>

     <p><strong>Withdrawal                   for Behavior that Interferes with the Instructional Process: </strong> Interactions in this class are expected to be professional and courteous. Disruptive                   behavior, which impedes the teaching/learning process for other students, will not be tolerated.                   An instructor may withdraw a student for disruptive behavior that is                   interfering with the instructional process (such as students using portable                   phones or radios, or harassing faculty or other students on forums or in person). For further                   information see “Students Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct” in                   the NCSU catalog. </p>
     <p>Please make sure                   you fully understand this agreement as you will be held to the entire                   policy as stated above. </p>
