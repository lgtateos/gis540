<p><strong>Abstract Example 1 </strong>(reads like a research abstract) </p>
<p>Encroachment of exotic trout species are confining brook trout, the only salmonid native to the southern Appalachians, to headwater streams. Land managers wish to understand the controls upon the ebb and flow cycles of encroachment and retreat of invasive salmonid species. Previous region-specific studies have investigated the impact of hydrologic, biologic, and land use controls as a function of stream reach elevation on salmonid distributions. Streambed grain size availability may be an additional control on species reproductive ability since brook trout use a significantly smaller grain size than the invasive salmonids in the construction of redds, the streambed mounds in which salmonids deposit their eggs. Further, field data confirms that streambed grain size decreases upstream, likely due to a higher prevalence of logjams upstream that impound fine sediment, which is consistent with the brook trout’s requirement for finer grains in redd construction.  </p>
<p>This project creates a streambed grain size model  to compare stream reach-averaged median grain size with surveys of native and nonnative salmonid locations obtained from previous studies. The Shields equation is used along with established hydraulic equations to model grain sizes in four streams in the Smoky Mountains of the southern Appalachians. Watershed and stream morphometrics obtained from a digital elevation model and field surveys conducted during the summer of 2010 provide inputs and validation for the model, respectively.  </p>
<p>Spatial median streambed grain size distribution can be relevant analysis in solving many problems. Channel design and engineering, pollutant transport, and paleoenvironment reconstructions are among topics that can benefit from modeling grain size distribution throughout streams. This model is generalized such that it can be used for numerous applications.</p>

  Synopsis:<br>
</strong>The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) data is available in kml format.  kml files can be viewed in Google Earth or ArcGIS, however, the format does not allow the attributes to be searched.  The National Parks Service needed a format that would facilitate this, such as an ArcGIS file geodatabase feature class. This project creates a script to parse the kml and build a corresponding file GDB feature class containing the same information. </p>
<p><strong>Abstract example 2</strong>  (reads like a technical document)</p>
<p>National Park Service managers need data from the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to evaluate the attributes of historic sites on park grounds. NRHP data is available only in kml format which can be viewed in  ArcGIS, but the attributes cannot be searched.   This project creates a script to parse the kml and build a corresponding file GDB feature class containing the attribute information.<br>
  <br>
The NRHP kml file contains a header followed by a series of placemark tags. Each placemark tag encloses information about a historic place. Figure 2 shows an example of this information displayed in Google Earth.  The information includes the name of the Historic Place, the geographic coordinate, and other details about the place. Each placemark tag is wrapped around a name tag, a description tag, a styleUrl tag, and a point tag (see Table 1 for details).  We are only interested in the information contained in the description and the point tags because the name is repeated in the description and the styleURL encodes how the point should be drawn in GoogleEarth.  The latitude and longitude contained in the description is not used because the coordinate information contained under the point tag is more precise.  Table 2 shows an example of the kml placemark code. </p>
<p>Within the description there is a special CDATA tag.  This tells the kml parser to ignore any special symbols found within.  This enables the description to contain any needed special symbols without misleading the kml parser.  However, for our purposes we need to parse the contents of the description, so the CDATA tags are stripped before any parsing is performed.   We parse the kml file and output a point feature class in a file geodatabase, selectively adding the fields listed in Table 3.  Figure 3 shows an example of Historic Place Information contained in a feature class as displayed in ArcMap. </p>
