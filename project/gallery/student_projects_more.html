        <p>In addition to monitoring and forecasting tropical cyclones during the current storm season, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) also provides storm track data for every tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin since 1851.  The State Climate Office of North Carolina is currently storing these historical observations in its CRONOS database, which it currently provides online through its Hurricane Search interface.  While statewide tropical cyclone statistics are readily available through the climate office website, many users desire statistics down to the county scale to determine how often storms affect their location.  The storm track data provided by the NHC does not include the storm’s diameter, so a buffer distance from the storm’s track must be estimated to determine whether the county “was affected by” a given storm.  With a given buffer distance provided, an analysis of the storm track data can then be performed to obtain a frequency of tropical cyclones that have affected the given county.</p>

This enables park officials to quickly identify areas affected by fire damage as well as the date and time of fire ignition. In order to transfer the raw data into visual format, csv data files need to be converted to shapefiles so that this information can be viewed in ArcMap.  As there are numerous records to transfer, it is beneficial to create a programming script that performs batch processing on the data files.  The csv2shp script will perform this task and allow a GIS technician to manipulate the resulting data in a map document.</p>

        <p>Production of high accuracy digital elevation models (DEM) can be achieved using laser radar data, also known as lidar. Current providers of free raw lidar data, such as the United States Geological Service (CLICK website), make the retrieval of large data sets convenient and timely. Unfortunately, these files are not immediately usable in the ArcGIS software suite. To make use of this data, conversion to an appropriate format (such as point data as provided in the LAS to Multipoint geoprocessing tool) is necessary. This process is fairly straightforward when handling single LAS files or multiple LAS files located in one folder. However, when multiple pages of files are downloaded from the CLICK website, the resulting data set consists of numerous zipped folders. These, in turn, contain multiple zipped LAS files, all of which are stored in one primary folder. My script performs batch processing on such folders and converts the raw LAS data into multipoint features. It also provides the user the option to convert and mosaic the new multipoint files into two separate DEMs, using two different interpolation methods.</p>

However, outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases still occur, with children being the most vulnerable. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010 of over nine thousand cases of the vaccine preventable disease pertussis, better known as whooping cough, were reported in California; a 63 year record high.  This project uses data collected by the California Department of Public Health, which records the immunization coverage of 2010 kindergarten classes, to visualize where vaccination rates are strong or lacking. </p>

In order to better manage this disease, farmers and extension personnel need to understand where the disease is most likely to affect crops in any given year. In order to determine this, fields throughout North Carolina are surveyed yearly for this disease and predictions about disease severity are made by county.

Through the use of python and VBA programming, I have made  considerable progress toward this goal. A customized ArcMap interface with toolbar  buttons will, depending on the button, display a dialog window, prompt for appropriate  user input or simply call a python script to perform an editing task. The main  feature of this project is a button labeled ‘Add New Data.’ It calls A<em>ddNewData.py</em> which adds new records to  one of three ArcMap document feature class layers based on data collected using  a GPS device. </p>

      During  my research, I have been attempting to estimate flow rates associated with  rainfall rates for a small tributary of Crabtree Creek. The ultimate goal is to  predict flooding events more accurately using modeled rainfall rates and to  back out rainfall rates where flow rate sensors exist. This information would  be very valuable to meteorologists and hydrologists, and would give them more  tools to better warn the public of impending flood events.  Often, I have found it very time consuming to  clip each shapefile in a directory to my desired research area. It would be  beneficial to have a script perform this tedious task.  Furthermore, I would like to select specific  elevations and create new shapefiles for further processing.   Finally, the shapefiles that were made were  added to the map display. These scripts automate several of the tedious tasks  and cut the data conditioning time to a minimum.</p>

      The Fire Management Office (FMO) of the Shenandoah National Park (SHEN) has several years worth of fuels data stored in a database and thousands of photos of the collection sites. The FMO would like to consolidate and visualize this data (create shapefiles) and possibly include reference to the photos in the shapefile as a column with relative path to the location of the photo. The data is geo-referenced, but must be converted to standard shapefiles. The consolidated data in the resultant shapefile will be used by FMO to help plan containment strategies in the event of a wild land fire. </p>

      The purpose of this project was to explore the use of Python  scripting, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripting, and ERSI ArcGIS  Desktop ArcObjects to develop an application that displays hiking, biking,  paddling and bridle trails located within a user selected North Carolina open  space. The user is presented with a list of open space names that can be  filtered by county, owner and manager. Once a selection is made, the open space  boundary and associated trails, hydrology, roads and points of interest (POI)  are draped over a 3D scene. The 3D scene is created using a hillshade raster  created from an elevation raster associated with the open space. Esri ArcScene  is the application used to render and manipulate the 3D scene.</p>
      <p>This use of this application is to help outdoor enthusiasts  identify trails that they may want to experience while visiting an area within  North Carolina. </p>

      Greece has  long been a hub for economic activity and flourishing civilizations.  A combination of geographical location and  accessibility to a range of natural resources made her a dominant force within  the ancient Mediterranean world. Greece is traditionally described as having a  rugged and harsh terrain.  It is curious  then, how these ancient people developed into such complex societies and were  constantly importing and exporting goods. To better understand how the people  of Greece made use of their trade routes an analysis on two of her predominant  natural resources (marble and lead-silver) will be performed. By examining the  locations in relation with their surrounding terrain and their distance to the  heart of Greece, Athens, a relative understanding of the amount of difficulty  it took for Grecian people to move goods can be derived.   </p>

      Archaeological projects usually involve sites within a  well-defined area. Some projects have a prehistoric component with hundreds, if  not thousands of cultural features (posts, pits…etc). Accurate spatial  information is recorded using a total station and then downloaded to computers  as digital spreadsheets. As analysis takes place in the lab, these spreadsheets  are often updated—ruling out some features as natural occurrences and appending  data to include other features or information about those cultural features.  The spreadsheets from fieldwork have north and east values truncated to 4  digits, rather than the necessary 6 or 7. This project was undertaken to find  the most recent version of the field work spreadsheet and automate the  generation of shapefiles from the data. Base layers (soils, streams, roads, and  contours) need to be clipped to a manageable extent surrounding the project  area, rather than the varied extents usually inherent in data from!
  numerous  sources.</p>

As a part of the study the office would like to  check for points that are near in time as well as space. This tool facilitates  this analysis by computing epoch time and consolidating all of the raw data  into two files, one for bears and one for people.  Both files are then converted to shape files.  The shape files are then used to compute a near table with the bears as in  features and the bears as near features. After processing the shape files can  be joined to the near table and the epoch time field can be used to determine  the amount of time that separates near features allowing the bear management  office to look for bear interaction.</p>

      <p>This project examines urban areas’  racial composition and different minority groups’ access to public open  space.  Three Python scripts are  developed and applied to a sample set of data from Wake County, North Carolina.  The objectives are to use readily available data from the county (open space  shape files) and sociodemographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau (census  block shape files) to produce a series of coefficient surface maps illustrating  the local variations in urban minorities’ access to open space.</p>

      <p>Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEVs) are  electric powered vehicles that are classified as “low speed vehicles”. This  means that they can only legally travel on roads with speed limits of 35mph or  less. Places with large areas with low speed limits, like university campuses  or army bases are ideal for NEV usage. I have created a tool that would take  road and building data and determine suitability for NEV travel in a city or  area of that city, based on the data provided. The tool analyzes the roads to  see which roads fall under the suitable speed limit and the  buildings near those roads to see if they are purely residential areas. Areas  with 50% or more of roads speed limit less than 35mph   with less than 50% residential usage are suitable for NEV usage, as they can travel around and  to attractions outside of residential areas.</p>
