This complexity causes spatial operation issues due to memory and  network capacity demand when performed using GIS services.

This solution provides a way to automate solving the vehicle routing problem and then deploying a set of written directions in a pdf map as well as in webmap form for the drivers to use. This saves both the analyst and drivers time.

        <p>NatureServe has developed the Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to rapidly assess vulnerability of animal and plant species to climate change using a scoring system based on predicted exposure and sensitivity to climate change.  The CCVI incorporates the overlay and classification of species ranges with both predicted and historical GIS climate data as factors of a species’ exposure and sensitivity to climate change.   The CCVI Toolset is a suite of tools that calculates exposure to predicted change in both moisture and temperature for single or multiple species in varying formats.  Future plans for the toolset include incorporating tools to calculate historical temperature and precipitation factors, exporting and/or creation of summarization reports, and interface improvements.</p>

Quantifying these changes in earth’s cryosphere aids researchers in developing models to predict the future impacts of climate change.  One method of assessing changes in ice and snow cover is through the analysis of satellite imagery, and due to the time-consuming nature of manually mapping the extent of snow cover from satellite imagery, this programming tool has been developed to automate the process of importing Landsat imagery into ArcGIS software, extracting areas of snow cover, and quantifying the results.  Analyzing these results may provide an effective means for elucidating the impact of climate change in a certain area.</p>

However, it can be difficult to understand how the surface is changing spatially using typical surface analyses such as slope or aspect maps.  Therefore, the purpose of this project is to show the fastest rate of change in a high resolution DEM by generating a gradient vector field, to more clearly visualize coastal evolution.  Mapping the direction and magnitude the surface changes spatially using vector fields can increase understanding of the processes acting in coastal areas, and highlight the vulnerability of certain coastal areas.</p>

Results from these processes are often shared within the agency and sometimes shared between agencies. This requires extracting sub groups of shapefiles and related information from larger datasets. Additionally, the individual(s) receiving the information are often not GIS experts and would benefit from having information that is easily accessed and digestible. The purpose of this project was to create a tool that extracts previously identified areas of high conservation value (polygons) along with relevant information (i.e. land ownership, species diversity, etc.) according to user selected county boundaries, map these areas, and automatically generate a summary report for the end user regarding acreages of conservation area(s),  species  diversity for selected areas, and acreages by landowner type.</p>

As a result, state- and national-level analyses pertaining to access to care are often infeasible.  The most readily available and reliable proxy for exact coordinate location is zip code; however, zip codes may contain more than one hospital, which are displayed by ArcMap as a single point.

This program can query and receive elevation data from Google Maps using shapefiles containing address fields and dynamically create elevation field in the shapefiles and generate DEM using interpolation.

      When  analyzing study sites, a researcher often needs to extract portions of rasters  covering the specific areas. The Pine Beetle Forest Fragmentation study at NCSU  has a set of National Land Cover Datasets (NLCD) from which they need to create  a raster containing exactly the study area. In some instances the study area  can be extracted from one raster. In other instances portions of many rasters  need to be extracted and mosaiced together. The distribution and amount of Pine  Forest can then be determined from the single raster aligning with the study  area. This project implements a tool that uses a shapefile to define the study  area and then clips a directory of rasters to that study area. Finally, the  project creates a mosaic of the rasters. While this project was created for the  Pine Beetle Forest Fragmentation study, it is applicable to any project using  rasters.</p>

One of the main uses of this is as an input into an algorithm that produces a national dataset, so it is necesary to see where we have LiDAR coverage.

The aim of this project is to convert the raw data output from the WSN,  preprocess the data using Python, and then import it into ArcGIS.  This will be the first step in creating a VBA  user-friendly interface in ArcGIS where the geographic and sensory data can be  visualized, manipulated, and tested against different models of interest.</p>

Usually there are several iterations of the entire test until the  corrected combination is found which satisfies all of the required tests.  The test includes: 1)The area proposed for annexation must be  contiguous. 2) At least 1/8 of the aggregate external boundary  must coincide with the current Municipal limit. 3) No part of the area can be within another  Municipality, and 4) considers the number of people per acre within the region.
The project automates these tests for a set of selected properties and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to elicit user input.   The results indicate if the selected area meets the statutory standards for annexation.</p>

       <p>The <em>glacial buzz saw theory</em>  proposes that glaciers are such  effective agents of erosion they are able to subdue the majority of mountain  range elevations to at or near the snowline altitude. If this is true, a topographic signature identified by both a  concentration of land area and a decrease in hillslope steepness near the  snowline altitude should be identifiable. Many studies have tested this  hypothesis around the world using both hypsometry (proportion of land area per  unit elevation) and mean slope per unit elevation to support or refute evidence  for a glacial buzz saw. However, no easy to reconstruct or standard method has  been developed to construct these data plots from digital elevation models  (DEMs). This project solves this problem, with an easy to use script that  generates data tables from DEMs that can be used to construct hypsometry and  mean slope vs. elevation plots.<br />

       <p>In  the Wayne County Planning Department, one of their ongoing tasks is maintaining  addresses using GIS.  This is done simply  with high resolution orthographic imagery and the Editor toolbar in ArcMap,  using points as address locators.   Address points coincide with land parcels, which are maintained as a  separate shapefile within the tax department.   The parcel lines accuracy within the GIS is important. Each parcel has  an auto-generated and unique Parcel Identification Number (PIN). When address  points are created and/or modified by the Planning Department the PIN attribute  of the individual point must be manually entered or updated, according to the  PIN of the parcel in which it is situated.   Sometimes these PINs go unmatched by mistake, so this project aims to  provide a quick way to correct this problem using a simple Python script, VBA  code, and a custom interface in ArcMap.  </p>
