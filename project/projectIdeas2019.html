    <p><strong>Population Analysis Project</strong></p>
    <p>A  sample comma separated value (csv) file, containing 2010 U.S. Census data is  provided.  The csv contains attributes on  resident age and gender population by Census tract.  In its current state, the csv file can’t be  automatically joined with spatial data in ArcGIS because the table does not  conform to the required format.  A GIS  professional has been repeatedly performing the process described in this  report, by hand and has requested a tool to perform these steps automatically  to streamline the workflow. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/18idH42mv_SXET-dYm3DRNKUugXiR-WsoDnfYJEqR8v8/edit?usp=sharing">For more info, click here...</a></p>

    <p><strong>Wiki Map</strong> <strong> Project</strong></p>
    <p>In  this project, you will use Python to parse Wiki pages and map the  contents.  Wikipedia has many 'List  of&quot; web pages that contain lists of points of interest (POI), such as  museums or airports.<a href="../supMaterials/projects/WikiMap.docx">  For more info, click here...</a></p>

    <p><strong>Wildfire Ignitions Project</strong><br />
      <br />
A csv file containing fire ignitions data needs to be reformated so that it can be imported as a point shapefile.  The csv contains  fire  ignition attributes, i.e. date, acreage, location. The csv  contains  fire ignition attributes, such as, dates, acreages, locations, and  so forth.    A GIS professional has  been repeatedly performing preprocessing and geoprocessing  by hand each time a new file is acquired and  has requested a tool to perform these steps automatically to streamline the  workflow.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1xtQrdfz72Wam0i4u3wPhAWgSr8SZlBdRDKVeOkHEFx0/edit?usp=sharing">For more info, click here...</a></p>

    <p><strong>Weather Data  Project</strong><br />
      <br />
    FAWN  “Florida Automated Weather Network” is a series of 36 weather stations spread  throughout the state of Florida that collect various types of weather data. A sample  zip file containing comma separated value (csv) files, with FAWN data is  provided.  The csv contains weather data attributes  such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and so forth.  In its current state, the csv file can’t be  automatically uploaded into ArcGIS and visualized as weather data.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1wi7ksoBJ6UVuLtV-RmOswc3aE7OaJpiGo4voDtgZ4jc/edit?usp=sharing">For more info, click here...</a></p>

    <p><strong>Potato Blight Project</strong>    </p>
    <p>This project involves working with data extracted from documents written in the mid-1800s, during the potato blight outbreak that led to the Irish Potato Famine. The disease appeared in the US prior to appearing in Ireland. &nbsp;The pathogen that caused the disease is known, but how the disease spread through the US is still uncertain. To learn more about the patterns of spread, researchers are using natural language processing to study historical agricultural documents and extract passages from these that contain both mentions of potato disease and mentions of geographic locations. This project aims to make maps out of the data that has been collected through this procedure. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NJM09QXnvXJa7aAhK5TJcKSkRvsGBQIwoVRT4muu41E/edit">See the extended description and sample data linked here.</a></p>

    <p><strong>Pokemon Go</strong></p>
    <p><span data-pats="text">The  tables provided with this project are representative of information you can download about the game.   Your challenge would be to map and analyze this type of data.   Can you think of any reason why NSA analysts might be interested in   studying data like this?   You can make a tool that searches for   patterns in the data like, which Pokemon characters have more compact   location sightings than others?  What areas (if any) do the Pokemon   characters avoid?  For each character, are do they show up near roads or   streams?  Is there a particular land cover Pokemon characters appear   in?   Are there correlations between appearances (do certain Pokemon   characters show up near each other consistently)? For most of these   questions, you can ask analogous ones about Pokestops.   Can you come up with other interesting questions to answer?  </span></p>
    <p><span data-pats="text">For this project, the code needs to create spatial data from this   input.  There are no headers in the data, so you can use the metadata   provided below.  It could perform the kind of analysis requested by the   user (who could also specify if she wanted all or just certain pokemon   Pokemon characters included in the analysis).  You can chose to   implement a subset of the suggestions above or come up with your own   questions.  Then the tool would map the data (one layer for each   character or stop) and write an HTML report containing imagery and any   statistical results from the analysis.</span></p>
    <p><span data-pats="text">Here are the data files. <a href="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ipoh07c5t9e6jy/h5lgvbuhcyg4ut/iufwu8izxeqd/pokemon.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pokemon.zip</a> The excel file contains the pokemon name to ID mapping (you may not   need to use any of the other info in the Excel file).  The csv files   don't have any headers; here's the schema:<br />

    <p><strong>Eye tracker project</strong>    </p>
    <p>An  eye tracker  is a device that tracks the locations of a  viewer’s gaze dwells (fixations) and the movements from one fixation to another  (saccades) on an electronic display.  The eye tracker device  in the NCSU GIS Visualization Lab can be used with ArcMap to gather data that  specifies where on a map a user is focusing as well as when and how long their  gaze lingers.  The eye tracking data is  saved to a file in comma separated value (csv) format. In this project you'll be performing analysis on this spatial data.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1dwv0hUqHQ9tHtgEwH199zc3DzwrjO98QH9LjY64WwSM/edit?usp=sharing">For more info, click here...</a>    </p>

    <p><strong>Interagency Compliance Application<br />
    </strong><br />
The National Park Service is responsible for identifying  properties and points of interest that may be impacted due to anthropogenic  activities.  For example, if an abandoned  industrial site is to be converted to a wind farm, are there any National  Natural Landmarks that could be visually impaired?  Additionally, if a county is scheduled to  change zoning regulations, are there any Federal lands in the county that could  potentially be affected?  The application  is not designed for individual compliance applications, e.g.  viewshed or environmental impact assessments,  but rather to identify potentially impacted properties. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/document/d/1qhRYMSYeokGGRjOBxSx0e-sJI4_D01HX7U8aNHzNnDE/edit?usp=sharing">For more info, click here...</a></p>

    <p><strong>Shape 2 Point tool update</strong></p>
    <p>Many useful publicly posted ArcGIS tools are written in old version of Python for ArcGIS. For example, Dan Patterson's shapeToPoint tool is written for ArcGIS 9.2. The purpose of this script tool is to convert a point, multipoint, polyline or polygon layer to a unique point  shapefile or CSV file which contains X, Y values and Z/M if present.  Learn a useful skill --the ability to rewrite existing code --convert this tool to ArcGIS 10, improve and embellish on it. <a href="../supMaterials/ShapeToPoints.zip">Here's the current version.</a></p>
    <p>For sample data, you can use any polygon shapefile, such as COVER63p.shp</p>

    <p><strong>Fire photos project (inactive project--not available)<br />
      </strong><br />
      A fire ecologist has multiple photos for each fire plot  (168) monitored.  Each plot has been  revisited multiple times over the past decade.   These plots are visited annually to monitor trends in vegetation after a  wildland fire.  At each visit, multiple  photos are taken to document the overall structure and appearance of the  plot.  (Multiple photos for multiple  visits per plot) The fire ecologist needs to display photos from each visit per  plot to show natural resource managers changes to the plot over time.  (Photos shown must be same orientation.)<a href="supMaterials/SheddIdea2.docx"> For more info, click here...</a></p>
