    <p>For the project, you'll apply course topics to  a geospatial application area of your choice. The project will include GIS Programming in Python. </p>
    <p>The final submission will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> A short write-up describing the project.</li>
      <li>Map files, scripts, toolboxes, and data and any other supporting files needed to test the code. </li>
      <li>A short (total of 10 minutes max. = project explanation + recorded demo) project presentation to the class. Distance education students can submit a video if they can not attend and give a live presentation. Distance education students making their own video can use the free software called Jing to capture it or any other video capture software they have. Jing only allows up to 5 minutes capture per video, so you may need to capture it in two parts. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The project  allows students to apply what they've learned in the course to a problem that has arisen in their workplace or research. The projects often involve filtering raw data, performing  geoprocessing analysis on it, and visualizing the data.  Students will choose a project that is relevant to their area of interest and use their own data.  The project will require Python  scripting to perform data processing and build ArcMap GUIs. </p>
    <p>For example, suppose your research routinely requires you to download  spatial data that comes in a csv format that  can't be loaded directly into ArcMap.  You have to open it, delete the  header, remove dashes from the field names, and delete extra columns.   Then it takes several additional steps to add it to a map (choose the  x, y  fields, project it, save it as a layer) so that you can display  it.   If you only had to do this once or twice, it's no big deal, but  since you have to do it all the time, writing some scripts to automate  the process would save a great deal of time in the long run.  This  would be a typical project for the course. <a name="draft" id="draft"></a></p>
    <p>As part of your course homework,  one-third of the way through the semester, you will submit a proposal for your project. Each proposal that is submitted will be scrutinized by the instructor for appropriate application of the scripting concepts and sufficient complexity. If the proposed project is not sufficiently complex or challenging, the proposal will be rejected and a project will be assigned by the instructor, in which case the project topic is non-negotiable.<br />

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The purpose of this program will be to apply farmland best management practices(BMP) to parcels of land entered by the user.  Examples of BMP are stream and water body vegetation buffers, and runoff control from roads and other compacted surfaces. This program will also output area of lakes or ponds,  and lengths of rivers, creeks, and roads in feet.</p>
          <p><strong>Data:</strong> Examples of data would be shapefiles such as lakes, roads and streams. However, the ideal program would extract this data from the entire parcel of land, sort the usable shapefiles and perform the BMP on the shapefiles.</p>
          <p><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Out of the shapefiles the program will perform a buffer tool on all water bodies.  It will also calculate length of roads and slope to determine in what lengths of road erosion control is needed.</p>

      <p><strong>I.  TITLE:</strong> Water Supply Model Sensitivity Analysis</p>
        <p><strong>II. ABSTRACT:</strong></p>
        <p> The U.S. Forest Service’s Eastern Forest Environmental Threat Assessment Center (EFTETAC) has developed a Water Supply Stress Index Model (WaSSI) that uses a set of 11 soil moisture parameters developed by the National Weather Service for use in flood forecasting. When properly calibrated, these soil moisture parameters can help accurately model daily hydrographs. However, the WaSSI model predicts water supply issues on a time frame of months to years and over areas where the parameters cannot be calibrated to actual runoff values.  Ideally, a sensitivity analysis could determine which soil parameters are necessary and which could be eliminated from the model. A cursory analysis showed that only four parameters had a substantial effect on twenty year average annual runoff values.  However, the model underestimates runoff during dry months, which is compensated by over estimation during wetter months.  A more sophisticated analysis at the monthly time frame needs to be conducted. </p>
        <p><strong>III. DATA:</strong></p>
        <p> * Eleven soil moisture parameter rasters for the conterminous U.S.<br />
          * Boundary shapefile for 2099 watersheds by HUC-8 code.<br />
          * Water supply model:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Input parameter file (CSV) of average soil parameters by HUC-8<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Output monthly data (CSV) from 1981-2000 by HUC-8 code.<br />
          * Historic runoff data for a set of 10 watersheds from 1961-2007</p>
        <p><strong>IV. BATCH PROCESSING:</strong></p>
        <p> * Create 22 input files, by modifying each parameter by one standard deviation.<br />
          * Run the model for each input file.<br />
          * Calculate a sensitivty index or the percent difference between the outputs.<br />
          * Pivot each index so that columns are average month index data by HUC-8</p>

      <p>2. Clear/brief? <br />
        --An expert in hydrology might find the proposed work easy to understand. A novice might need to read it a few times and then the still have questions. For example, the main idea seems to be runnng the sensitivity analysis on monthly flood model output so as to identify the most influential parameters amongst a large number of model input parameters. This purpose should be stated first before getting into details about the model. The description is, however, laudably brief.<a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a></p>
      <p>3. Batch processing? <br />
        --Yes, there are several loops, some nested.</p>
      <p>4. Is the complexity sufficient? <br />
        --Yes. It's easy to see how this project could require some of the advanced techniques for code-reuse which are taught in the second half of the course.</p>
      <p>5. Is the pseudocode efficient and correct? <br />
      The pseudocode is correct and seems to be efficient, though if any of these loops are consuming the same data, they could be combined. In this proposal, it doesn't seem to be the case, but a simple example of this is shown in the following pseudocode:</p>
      <p>FOR each input file:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPUTE a 1-mile buffer.<br />
ENDFOR<br />
      </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPUTE the record count.<br />
        ENDFOR</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPUTE a 1-mile buffer.<br />

              <li>Avoid use of 'magic numbers' -- hard-coded numbers unique values with   unexplained meaning and/or multiple occurrence which could (preferably) be   replaced with meaningfully named variables. <span class="head"><a name="format" id="format"></a></span></li>
              <li>Catch exceptions, as appropriate.</li>
              <li>Lines of code &lt;=80 characters each. Achieve this by using variables to   hold long string arguments and using line continuation symbols as needed. </li>
              <li>Use docstrings.</li>

    <p>Your files must be  organized  into <strong>data, documentation</strong>, and <strong>code</strong> subdirectories with just the map or main script on he top level. Be sure to test your code to make sure it works in this configuration.<img src="images/aaexampleProjSubmission.png" /><br />
      <strong><br />
      </strong>The <strong>documentation</strong> subdirectory should contain the text report, the videos (distance ed. only), Powerpoint (if applicable) thumbnail image. <img src="images/aaexampleDocumentation.png" width="564" height="367" /><br />

    <p>The <strong>data</strong> directory should contain a small sample data file which can be used to demonstrate the application, workspaces, databases, and so forth. These can be organized however it makes sense to organize them for your project. In this image, she has data arranged in subfolders, but if you just have a few input/output files, you may just want to put these on the top level of the data directory.</p><a name="sumbission" id="submission"></a>

    <p>Final projects sometimes exceed the space available on Wolfware for submission, so we have set up a special server for this purpose. To submit your project:<br />
        <br />
      IF you are using a CNR lab machine: <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type <strong>\\cnrdata.cnr.ncsu.edu\geospatial$\Education\GIS540\projectsF2014</strong> in a Windows  Explorer window. <br />
    </p>
    <p>ELSE (you not using a CNR lab machine):<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect through a virtual private network (VPN) to get access to this directory. To do this login at <a href="https://dc1-vpn-1.ncstate.net/+CSCOE+/logon.html">vpn.ncsu.edu</a>.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next type<strong>\\cnrdata.cnr.ncsu.edu\geospatial$\Education\GIS540\projectsF2014</strong> in a Windows  Explorer window<br />
      For the username type: WOLFTECH\unityid and use your unity password.<br />
    </p>
    <p>--For the <strong>Project Press Release</strong>, submit your text document in the ABSTRACTS directory and submit your thumbnail image in the THUMBNAILS directory.</p>
    <p>---Place <strong>all other project materials</strong> in your <em>userid</em> subdirectory as described in the "Submission Format" section on this page.  If you don't see one with your id, create it. Place a file in your project directory now to confirm  that you have access to it.   You can add or delete files, just as you  would to any directory where you have write access, so you should upload  incomplete versions of your project ahead of time.<br />
