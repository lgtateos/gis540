      <li><strong>What is Wolfware?<br />
        </strong>Wolfware is an NCSU web-based course management system  used for some courses at NCSU for  delivering online course content.  Courses can be found at <a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu">http://courses.ncsu.edu.</a> From here,  the students access their courses' online content and tools. The tools  include discussion forums, gradebooks, and feedback.   For more information, see <a href="http://classic.wolfware.ncsu.edu/help/CH10-eosguide06.pdf">http://classic.wolfware.ncsu.edu/help/CH10-eosguide06.pdf</a><strong><br />

      </strong></li>
      <li> <strong>What is Moodle?<br />
      </strong>Moodle is an open source course management system  used for some courses at NCSU to deliver online course materials.  Some of the components of Moodle   that may be used by the instructor are chat, discussion forums, wikis, and announcements. For more information, <a href="http://moodle.wolfware.ncsu.edu/course/view.php?id=4173">watch the orientation video linked here</a>.<br />

      <li><strong>What is the VCL? </strong><strong><a name="collaborate" id="collaborate"></a></strong><br />
        <a href="http://vcl.ncsu.edu/">VCL stands for Virtual Computing Lab</a>. NCSU VCL provides a remote access service that allows you to reserve a   computer with a desired set of applications for yourself, and remotely   access it over the Internet. This gives you free access to  useful applications such as ArcGIS, PythonWin, Matlab, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and many others. Watch this <a href="http://www5.hmc.edu/vcldemo.html">VCL demonstration video</a> to see how it works.<a href="http://vcl.ncsu.edu/"><br />

      </a></li>
      <li><strong>What is Jing?</strong><br />
        <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/download/jing/">The free version of Jing</a> allows you to capture an image or an (up to) 5 minute video. Then you have the   option to  save it to disk, copy to clipboard, or best of all put it on the web and get a link to it at Screencast.com. This is a great communcation tool for explaining 'what goes wrong when I try to do it'. Download the software and install it on your desktop. Watch the <a href="http://video.techsmith.com/jing/2.1/overview/default.asp">overview video</a><a href="http://www.jingproject.com/"> to see why it's useful.<br />
<br />
</a></li>
      <li><strong>What is Blackboard Collaborate?<br />
        </strong>Blackboard Collaborate  provides remote desktop sharing with chat and voice   interaction for participants with microphones. For example, you can be   at home talking to your TA at NCSU and show her exactly what's happening   on your computer or vice versa.    Instructors using this tool will provide a link to their session or the   name of their session which you can search when you log in to<a href="http://collaborate.wolfware.ncsu.edu"> NCSU Blackboard Collaborate here</a>. When you go to participate in a session,  you will be prompted to allow your   browser to run the Java Web Start Launcher. Watch <a href="http://www.brainshark.com/blackboardinc/vu?pi=zGLzYw5XBz35Sgz0">this   video</a> to see how it works.<br />

      <li><strong>What program should I use to capture my project presentation?</strong><br />
      We recommend <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a>. It is a free program and quite easy  to install and use for recording video (it also has nice screen capture capabilities). It only allows you to record in 5 minute increments, but that's okay with us. Save your screen captures, labeling them so that we can understand the appropriate ordering, and them submit the files as instructed on the project page.<br />

      <li><strong>How can I  get the VPN to work on Windows 8?</strong><br />
        if you are running windows 8 you may need to make sure you have the   latest vpn software. Some times the version that is auto installed is   not the latest.  Note you have to scroll   down to get to the unsupported windows 8. Here is a link to the latest as of Dec 2013:<br />

      <li><strong>I just installed PythonWin and I get an error when I import arcpy. What's wrong?<br />
      </strong>We have seen an issue in the past where the path file is not set correctly in PythonWin. To make sure your PythonWin is configured correctly open PythonWin and type import arcpy in the Interactive Window and hit enter. If you receive any errors, then your path is not set correctly. To correct that, open <br />
      C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pywin32.pth with notepad.exe and copy the following lines into the file and save:<br />
      <br />
      C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\Lib\\site-packages\\pythonwin<br />
        C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Desktop10.1\arcpy<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\DLLs<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\lib<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\lib\\plat-win<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\lib\\lib-tk<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\Lib\\site-packages\\pythonwin<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\lib\\site-packages<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\lib\\site-packages\\win32<br />
        C:\\Python27\\ArcGIS10.1\\lib\\site-packages\\win32\\lib<br />
        C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Desktop10.1\ArcToolbox\Scripts<br />
      C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Desktop10.1\Bin<br />
      <br />
      Then retest by closing PythonWin and starting it again and typing import sys …then import arcpy. If you don’t get an error, it’s working correctly.<strong><br />

      <li><strong>I'm using ArcGIS 10. PythonWin is hanging when I import Python or set the workspace environment variable. What's wrong?<br />
        </strong>Make sure your service packs are up-to-date.<strong><br />

      <li><strong>How do you use the Raster Calculator from Arcpy?<br />
        </strong>You can't<strong>. </strong>The <span purpose="gptoolref"><a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//009z000000z7000000.htm">Raster Calculator</a></span> tool is built for use in the ArcGIS Desktop application only as a GP tool dialog box   or in ModelBuilder. It is not  intended for use in scripting and is not   available in the ArcPy Spatial Analyst module. To perform raster calculator type operations from a script, call map algebra tools (plus, minus, times, etc.).<strong><br />

      <br />
      </li>
      <li><strong>The Python print statement won't work after I call gp.CalculateField or some other tool. </strong><br />
This is a known unsolved 9.3 Esri  bug. Workaround: write  to a text file rather than printing.<br />

      <li><strong>I have a set of custom VBA buttons/tools from Arc 9.x and I want to   migrate them to Arc 10.x. Would the best solution be to migrate them to VB.NET and deploy them as Esri "Add-In's"? These old VBA buttons/tools use ArcObjects and have custom forms/etc.</strong><br />
        <br />
I recommend using Script Tool interface   capabilities, which have really improved in recent versions of Arc. You can create some nice GUI's   just using those.  <br />
Here's Esri's Script Tool help:<br />
<a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//001500000006000000.htm">http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//001500000006000000.htm</a><br />
 Also,  search on "script tool" in the course schedule to see related slides.<br />
<br />
        Esri recommends VB or C# flavored Add-ins as a replacement for VBA   interfaces.  <br />
        Here's a tutorial on the topic: http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_net/conceptualhelp/index.html#//0001000001ms000000<br />
        There are some drawbacks to the VB or C# Add-ins:<br />
        <ol><li>VB or C# are lower level programming languages, thus more difficult to learn (than Python).  </li>
        <li>You need to use MS Visual Studio (see this    ) but:<br />
        a. Vis Studio is very powerful and much more complex than, say, PythonWin<br />
        b. Vis Studio is expensive (though free while you're a student) and   unless you work for a company that happens to be in software   development, they probably won't have a licence.        </li>
        <li>Creating Add-ins is straightforward for the canned examples in the   tutorial, but going beyond those examples would involve much more time.</li></ol>
        <br />
        One other thought is that Arc 10.1 is going to provide Python Add-ins.    Watch the Virtual Campus course on the topic to find out more.  It   looks...well, it still looks like more work than simply creating a Script Tool, though it seems better than VB or   C# Add-ins, because there's no need Vis Studio, and Python is easier than either   of these languages.   The other consideration is they haven't yet added all of   the functionality that VB and C# have to the Python add-ins.<br />
