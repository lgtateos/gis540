#List .shp files Python code:

import os

try:
    dir = "C:/Temp"
    filelist = os.listdir(dir)
    for file in filelist:
        if file.endswith(".shp"):
            print file
except:
    print "Warning: an error occurred.\n"

#\ is a special character called the escape character. Confusing as it may be, to indicate that we're not escaping, but rather referring to the character itself, you have to use double slashes \\.
