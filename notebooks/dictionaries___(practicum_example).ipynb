    "#### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completing this hands-on, a participant will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe purpose of a Python dictionary, \n",
    "* List some geospatial applications of dictionaries,\n",
    "* Create and modify a dictionary with Python.\n",
    "* Access dictionary values using a key.\n",
    "* Explain the difference between using an index and using access-by-key,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "You are already familiar with int, float, bool, string, tuple, set, and list data types and you've been using these data structures to work with geospatial applications.  Now you'll see another data type, dictionaries that can help you manage your gis data. Dictionaries provide a way to associate related values.  They are sometimes referred to informally as look-up tables, as they allow you to look up one value based on another value.  For example, you can use dictionaries to get month names based on their abbreviations or to look up a city's population based on the city's name. In cases where field name languages vary across datasets, dictionaries can serve as a translator so that the code can look up the English translation of Spanish field names. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like lists, dictionaries can be easily changed, shrunk, and grown. Dictionaries can be contained in lists and vice versa.  But what's the difference between lists and dictionaries? The main difference is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries consist of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. Each dictionary key is associated with a value.  So, dictionaries consist of key-value-pairs. Dictionaries don't support indexing like strings, tuples and lists.  Instead, you must use access-by-key.   This notebook provides several dictionary examples to give you a feel for how they work."

    "\n",
    "1. Read the text above the first code cell you come to. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click on the code cell that you want to run. This highlights the cell, indicating it's ready for execution.  Try to predict the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Execute the Cell: Use the \"Run\" button in the notebook interface (or press Shift + Enter). Note: There are several questions in this notebook that prompt you to add code before running a code cell.   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. View Output: After running the cell, any output generated by the code (such as print statements, results of computations, or visualizations) will appear directly below the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Read the text explanation before the next code cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Proceed to next code cell: Move through the notebook by repeating the above steps for each subsequent cell, executing them in sequence to follow the flow of the analysis or code narrative.\n",
